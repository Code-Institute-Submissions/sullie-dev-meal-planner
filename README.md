# Dish Generator

[View project here](https://meal-planner.sullie.repl.co/) Thisdemo project is
hosted on [replit.com](https://replit.com/) and may take several minutes to boot
up when launching the project first

---

For this project I have built a terminal password manager in python, the program
allows the user to input & save new passwords along with view passwords based on
the website name, username/email, or password name.

All the passwords are encrypted and stored on a PostgreSQL database on Heroku,
when the user retrieves the passwords they are decrypted and displayed to the
user
